React tools for Vim

**This is not ready to be used in general**

It's still a bit buggy, and the feature-set is not fully fleshed out yet.
I'm still figuring out how installation with TimL will work, so it might not install at the moment.
That said, if you'd like to try it and give feedback or feature ideas feel free :)

## Installation

Install it like any other Vim plugin, the one difference is that this depends
on [TimL](https://github.com/tpope/timl), so that must be installed as well.
